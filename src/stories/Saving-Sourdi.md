Let's have a nice tree right here. You need to have a very firm paint to do this. We'll put a happy little sky in here. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown.

Here's something that's fun. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them.

I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Do an almighty painting with us. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. A beautiful little sunset. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it.

And maybe a little bush lives there. See there, told you that would be easy. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. It's important to me that you're happy.
