*Once, when my older sister, Sourdi, and I were working alone in our family's restaurant, just the two of us and the elderly cook, some men got drunk and I stabbed one of them. I was eleven.* 

*I don't remember where Ma had gone that night. But I remember we were tired and it was late. We were one of the only restaurants that stayed open past nine in those days. The men had been growing louder, until they were our only customers, and, finally, one of them staggered up and put his arm across Sourdi's shoulders. He called her his "China doll" and his friends hooted at this.*

Author May-lee Chai is the first of her family to be born in the United States, and she has lived in 14 states since. This unique experience is evident as we are introduced to Nea and Sourdi, two sisters working in their mother's restaurant in South Dakota, their first relocation as a family after a rough arrival in Texas. Careful readers will note the tense in which Nea speaks about their relocation—*When we moved to South Dakota, I thought we'd find the real America, the one where we were supposed to be, not the hot sweaty America where we lived packed together in an apartment with bars on the windwos on a street where angry boys in cars played loud music and shot guns at each other in the night*. Considering Nea is telling the story in the past-tense, we can immediately contextualize this experience in the restaurant with Sourdi as formative to Nea's disposition.

In analyzing whether a character is static—fundamentally unchanged by the end of a narrative—or dynamic—fundamentally different—it is important to consider the timeline in which we the reader are exposed to the narrator. Nea has changed since arriving in South Dakota but we are introduced to her well after age eleven. As Nea relives this collection of memories to the reader, the reader is piecing together some fragmented version for the first time. Nea has a dynamic personality, but in this context it might be more useful to think of her as round (as opposed to flat). Beginning with the stabbing, Nea's instincts are to protect Sourdi. When answering the question of whether Nea is static or dynamic, consider Nea's instincts in the end.

Furthermore, Nea is clearly not in a position to affect the universe she inhabits on a grand scale. It is this lack of control that begs the reader to interpret the story from this perspective, a universal perspective of childhood when the world is still too large to begin to understand. Nea is traumatized by the way that men sexualize and objectify Sourdi. However valid Nea's trauma is, it is important to recognize that Sourdi's life is carefully obfuscated by Chai, such that it is difficult to conclude, or refute, with certainty that Nea's fears about Sourdi's domestic life are true. At the story's climax the reader may feel a sense of apprehension about whose version of events is reliable.

If you enjoyed reading *Saving Sourdi* you will be pleased to know that May-lee Chai continues to write from Nea's perspective in her novels *Dragon Chica* (2010) and *Tiger Girl* (2013).
