*I come from some other place. It's not like a real place or something I could point to on a map, if I even had a map of this other place, which I don't. There's no map because the place isn't a place like something to be near or in or at. It's not somewhere or anywhere, but it's not nowhere either. There is no where about it. But it certainly isn't this place, here on Earth, with all you silly people. I wish I new what it was, not because I think it would be great to tell you about it; I just miss it so much. If I knew what it was, maybe I could make something like it here on Earth. Waldemar says it's impossible. The only way to get there is to go.*

As this anthology draws closer to the end, our narrators have strayed further from the familiarity of heroic pursuit, onto the stubborn, and the mundane. In each of the previous examples, the unreliability of each respective narrator shapes the ways in which we empathize with their goals. What if rooting for the narrator to succeed in their pursuit was to root for their death? The reader may have begun to notice that although there are an absence of external power dynamics driving these narratives, power is not entirely absent. Instead we are analyzing the power one has over their actions. As readers we are given some of what characters thinks and says, but it's up to us to question how their actions align with their, often boldly stated, intentions.

Urszula is unreliable in a way that may be new to some readers, but is actually quite common to the origins of storytelling. In traditional stories, information is sometimes introduced into a story seemingly at random. In television, we might call this plot armor, or bad writing, but in traditional stories readers are not meant to be concerned with the *why* or *how* of it all, only that it happened. In this way, readers may sense something otherworldly about Urszula, not just that she wishes to escape, or return, to *some other place*, or that she feels alien, but the manner in which she acquires information. When she learns she might be able to go to the other place, if only she kills the right person, the reader will notice something fantastical about the way in which her impulsive knowledge of who is the right person is affects the trajectory of the story. 

Urszula's conviction to prioritize herself is admirable in many ways, however the reader may find it difficult to support her as the consequences of her desire become more obvious. When the *right *person* just so happens to be a man who abused her mother, the woman, we are left to consider whether learning this has altered her pursuit at all. Unlike traditional stories, fiction does not have a clear moral outcome, there is not always an obvious hero. Before reading the story, read below what author and screenwriter Ottessa Moshfegh said to [Bookforum](https://www.bookforum.com/print/2802/bookforum-contributors-on-the-risky-books-they-d-like-to-read-now-24492) in 2021 and consider her perspective as you begin.

*I wish that future novelists would reject the pressure to write for the betterment of society. Art is not media. A novel is not an “afternoon special” or fodder for the Twittersphere or material for journalists to make neat generalizations about culture. A novel is not BuzzFeed or NPR or Instagram or even Hollywood. Let’s get clear about that. A novel is a literary work of art meant to expand consciousness. We need novels that live in an amoral universe, past the political agenda described on social media. We have imaginations for a reason. Novels like American Psycho and Lolita did not poison culture. Murderous corporations and exploitive industries did. We need characters in novels to be free to range into the dark and wrong. How else will we understand ourselves?*

## Questions

1. Why do you think Waldemar *figured out* a second way for Urszula to *get back to the place*?
2. What does Urszula's name for her mother, the woman, communicate about their relationship?
3. How does the woman's favorable treatment of Waldemar affect him? Do you consider Waldemar to be protective or envious of Urszula?
4. Urszula lies to other people, but is arguably the most forthcoming narrator to the reader since Nea. Compare and contrast the two, as well as the anti-hero you selected before (if you selected one). What core similarities do you notice about them?
