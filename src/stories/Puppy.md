*Twice already Marie had pointed out the brilliance of the autumnal sun on the perfect field of corn, becuase the brilliance of the autumnal sun on the perfect field of corn put her in mind of a haunted house—not a haunted house she had ever actually seen but the mythical one that sometimes appeared in her mind (with adjacent graveyard and cat on a fence) whenever she saw the brilliance of the autumnal sun on the perfect etc., etc.—and she wanted to make sure that, if the kids had a corresponding mythical haunted house that appeared in their minds whenever they saw the brilliance of the etc., etc., it would come up now, so that they could all experience it together, like friends, like college friends on a road trip, sans pot, ha ha ha!*

Up until now we have analyzed unreliability in first-person narratives. This is primarily because it can be more challenging to question a third-person narrator who is typically intended to be separate from the cast, and without identity or growth to track. The stream of consciousness technique offers a different kind of omniscience. In contrast to the kind of material and sequential authority of third-person narration, stream of consciousness narration offers an otherworldly authority on a character's emotions. In the case of *Puppy* it is left to the reader to parse the internal monologues of two mothers, separated by sections, and consider the effect of their internal monologues on their external lives.

Author George Saunders often employs a unique stream of consciousness in his stories. Upon encountering Callie, following the introduction to Marie, the reader should be able to identify two distinct tones of voice, uncharacteristic of a typical third-person narrator, but also be able to sense similarities due to Saunders' style. Where the previous story dissected classism through the lens of institutional racism, the classism in *Puppy* is material and behavioral. In spite of their socioeconomic differences, both mothers have more in common than they know. The reader is in a unique position to feel badly for Marie and Callie because the stream of consciousness narrative informs us of similarities neither mother could know exists. 

Despite differences in tone, a similarity the reader may notice is the surface level of each mother's thoughts. When their internal monologue grazes against the uncomfortable past, take note of the ways in which each mother redirects and changes the subject, or laughs, *ha ha ha*, as if in the process of convincing themselves everything is alright. Both mothers are primarily concerned with their sons, each experiencing varying degrees of unspecified social and behavioral challenges. Their daughters, on the other hand, are hardly acknowledged amidst everything else floating around their minds. Their husbands seem to be the driving force behind each mother's state of mind—Marie having found her place in the world, Callie trying to suppress another violent outburst against an innocent animal.
