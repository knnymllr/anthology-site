Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.

Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want.

It's important to me that you're happy. All kinds of happy little splashes. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Just make a decision and let it go. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy.

I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy.
