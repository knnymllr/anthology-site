This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. At home you have unlimited time.

We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Every day I learn.

That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Working it up and down, back and forth. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world.

Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Be brave. There we are. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs.
