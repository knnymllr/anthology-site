I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees.

We'll put a happy little bush here. And just raise cain. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. Mountains are so simple, they're hard.

All those little son of a guns. Let's do that again. You can get away with a lot. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. This is a fantastic little painting.

Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. Here's something that's fun. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us.
