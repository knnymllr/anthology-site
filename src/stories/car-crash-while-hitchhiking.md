*A salesman who shared his liquor and steered while sleeping . . . A Cherokee filled with bourbon . . . A VW no more than a bubble of hashish fumes, captained by a college student . . .*

*And a family from Marshalltown who headonned and killed forever a man driving west out of Bethany, Missouri &nbsp; . &nbsp; . &nbsp; .*

*. . . I rose up sopping wet from sleeping under the pouring rain, and something less than conscious, thanks to the first three of the people I've already named—the salesman and the Indian and the student—all of whom had given me drugs.*

One of the primary goals of this anthology was to introduce the reader to characters whose static, unreliable nature is not emphasized by their power fantasy and the astronomical stakes of empire building. To conclude, we enter the mind of another nameless narrator whose omniscience is self-appointed. Much like Urszula, the narrator appears to know crucial details of the story well before they take place, however the opening sentences stand in stark contrast to this phenomenon. The narrator not only defines himself as unreliable, *something less than conscious*, but narrates unreliably, in a fragmented manner. Unlike the carefully curated mask worn by Sylvia to deflect Miss Moore, the chaotic nature of Johnson's narrator is not hiding anything. 

Following the car crash the narrator tells the doctor, *There's nothing wrong with me*, a declaration even he knows is untrue. Moments later he reflects on this as a trend in his life, and suddenly the timeline springs years into the future, when the narrator finds himself in Detox, still unwilling to admit anything. *I'm not ready to go into all that, I said. A yellow bird fluttered close to my face and my muscles grabbed. Now I was flopping like a fish. When I squeezed shut my eyes, hot tears exploded from the sockets. When I opened them, I was on my stomach.* The reader may find themselves disarmed by the sheer powerlessness of the narrator, contrasted against the grandiose authority he speaks about his life with. 

For additional context to this story, Denis Johnson got sober from all recreation drugs in 1983, the year he published his debut novel *Angels*. His *Three Rules To Write By* may be of interest to consider ahead of reading the text.

1. Write naked. That means to write what you would never say.
2. Write in blood. As if ink is so precious you can't waste it.
3. Write in exile, as if you are never going to get home again, and you have to call back every detail.
